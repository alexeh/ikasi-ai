# **App Name**: SyncSphere

## Core Features:

- Data Storage on Local MySQL Database: Store the main data on a local MySQL database server.
- Firebase Synchronization Setup: Allow connection between Firebase (deployed Next.js application) and local MySQL server to facilitate data synchronization.
- Data Change Monitoring in Firebase: Continuously monitor for data changes (CRUD operations) within the Firebase application.
- Two-Way Synchronization Trigger: Enable event triggers for both Firebase updates and local MySQL server updates to initiate synchronization processes.
- Verification Mechanism: Add verification step before final synchronization to confirm the changes
- Admin Approval Tool: An admin tool that uses LLM to analyze whether a synchronization step would be beneficial.
- Display Change Logs: A panel where changes made to the Firebase data can be displayed prior to synchronization.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to evoke trust and stability, important for a data synchronization app.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5), offering a neutral backdrop to ensure readability and reduce eye strain during extended use.
- Accent color: Vibrant orange (#FF9800), used sparingly to draw attention to key interactive elements and status indicators.
- Font pairing: Use 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for headings, creating a clean and readable interface.
- Use minimalist line icons to represent data entities, actions, and system states, ensuring clarity and reducing visual clutter.
- Implement a card-based layout for presenting synchronized items and pending changes, optimizing content organization.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and feedback animations to confirm user actions and highlight system synchronization states.
